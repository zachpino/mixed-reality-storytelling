### Week 2 · Simple Marker AR with A-Frame and Modeling in Maya

-----

Let's continue our exploration into [A-Frame](https://aframe.io), an emergent standard for creating web VR and AR content developed by the team behind Mozilla Firefox. Check out the many examples on their website, with both mobile and traditional computing devices.

This week we'll specifically look into A-Frame's Augmented Reality capabilities, which support both marker and markerless 3D model placement (through integration with [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/README.md)). All these experiences allow scripting with Javascript and styling and animation with friendly HTML attributes and CSS. 

We'll also focus on mesh-based modeling in Maya today!

##### Agenda 

- [Download Autodesk Maya](#download-autodesk-maya)
- [Create and Implement A-Frame Markers](marker.md) [or [Download Marker File](marker.patt)]
- [Install Maya GLTF Plugin](https://github.com/matiascodesal/maya-glTF)
- [Learn Maya Modeling Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdVBx1gpJwQ)

##### Download Autodesk Maya

First – let's get a big download out of the way. Visit the Autodesk Education Portal and download a [free!] student version of Autodesk Maya. We need Maya — the industry standard mesh-based modeling tool — in order to create more complex 3D objects and animations for our AR and VR experiences. 

[Autodesk Education](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/featured)

Sign-up first, and then download and install the *2018 English Version* for your platform of choice. If you have a previous version of Maya already installed, that will likely work fine too. You may want to screenshot your autogenerated serial number, as sometimes Autodesk takes a longtime to email you the credentials.

##### Homework

All of these *will be shared with the class*.

- Continue working with A-Frame, and **compose an animated scene reminiscent of an artist of your choice**. Push yourself on this, there are lots of interesting [resources available](https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/randomizer/) for a-frame.
- Visit somewhere in Chicago a VR or AR experience, and document yourself there with a selfie. Research the experience as best as you can. With what tools was it made? 
- Find an interesting digital AR/VR-enabled mobile application or website compatible with your Google Cardboard glasses. Can you find how it was created?
- Investigate AR and VR development tools, hardware, and software. If you could learn how to do anything in this course, what would it be? Prepare an argument.
