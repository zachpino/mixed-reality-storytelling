### Week 2 · Simple Marker AR with A-Frame and Modeling in Maya

-----

Let's continue our exploration into [A-Frame](https://aframe.io), an emergent standard for creating web VR and AR content developed by the team behind Mozilla Firefox. Check out the many examples on their website, with both mobile and traditional computing devices.

This week we'll specifically look into A-Frame's Augmented Reality capabilities, which support both marker and markerless 3D model placement (through integration with [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/README.md)). All these experiences allow scripting with Javascript and styling and animation with friendly HTML attributes and CSS. 

We'll also focus on mesh-based modeling in Maya today!

##### Agenda 

- [Download Autodesk Maya](#download-autodesk-maya)
- [Create and Implement A-Frame Markers](marker.md) [or [Download Marker File](marker.patt)]
- [Install Maya GLTF Plugin](https://github.com/matiascodesal/maya-glTF)
- [Learn Maya Modeling Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdVBx1gpJwQ)
- [Learn Maya Keyframe Animation Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSTRBRq3WqQ)
- [Embed Maya Animations in A-Frame Scenes](embed.md)

##### Download Autodesk Maya

First – let's get a big download out of the way. Visit the Autodesk Education Portal and download a [free!] student version of Autodesk Maya. We need Maya — the industry standard mesh-based modeling tool — in order to create more complex 3D objects and animations for our AR and VR experiences. 

[Autodesk Education](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/featured)

Sign-up first, and then download and install the *2018 English Version* for your platform of choice. If you have a previous version of Maya already installed, that will likely work fine too. You may want to screenshot your autogenerated serial number, as sometimes Autodesk takes a longtime to email you the credentials.

##### Homework

Follow the [tutorials from this week](embed.md) to create an animated AR scene in A-Frame featuring a Maya model. Use the [referenced tutorials above](agenda) to reinforce and accelerate your mesh-based modeling and animating skills. 

Install the glTF plugin into Maya, create a form, animate it, export it, and make sure it works in A-Frame for sharing! Design a rocket ship or a fish or bird and have it move around relative to your marker.

We will also discuss our choice of tools to learn as a class (as assigned first week). Have your arguments ready!
