# Briefs

Please individually select one of the three briefs below to spend the remaining 7 weeks of the semester on. All projects will progress through ideas and sketches, storyboards, art direction work, asset sourcing and creation, and finally coded buildout. 

Everyone should take advantage of Zach's time! Send Zach questions by the Friday before class and he promises to have as close to an answer as possible by the following Monday's class. Additionally, two outside-of-class individual/small group meetings are required. Office hours, as always, are Wednesdays 9-12 (just MRS) or Thursdays 9-12 (all classes). Other times are always possible too! 

Regardless of chosen brief, experiences will be evaluated on conceptual ambition and novelty (15%), regular development and class participation (25%), art direction and aesthetic coherency (30%), and final coded delibverable (30%).

Check-in deliverables and presentations will be introduced as needed to maintain regular progress.

Have fun with these!

## AR Teaching

Using marker or markerless AR overlays as well as hand-created and sourced 3d models, create an instructional experience for teaching some complex, real-world skill or content in a novel way. Ideally, this is a new skill that you yourself learn through the course of creating the experience. Examples of appropriate scope might include playing a song on an unfamiliar instrument, navigating and learning about a specific *cultural* space, executing a specific exercise healthfully, manipulating and assembling chemical elements and the periodic table, or teaching a user to cook some unknown meal. Additional inputs (sensors, wearables, cameras...) are totally allowed!

This experience is ideally fully comprehensive, but due to time constraints, could instead be an understandable and standalone slice of a larger planned curriculum. 

	#### Deliverables 
	- 3-5 minute interactive experience
	- Refined storyboard of *ideal* experience, as well as how design decisions intervene in *non-ideal* experiences
	- Compressed folder of all commented code and 2d/3d assets
	- Document of research into *how you teach* the skill/content and your learning objectives

	#### Considerations
	- How would your experience flex to support users of different levels? 
	- How will your experience diagnose success or failure? Is their feedback possible?
	- Is your experiences designed around repeated viewings?
	- How could interactive 3-dimensionality aid in learning objectives?

## Mixed Reality Narrative 

Create an interactive story that can only be experienced in VR (Cardboard or Oculus). This story should be fully told in a 3-5 minute engagement. The content and art direction of the narrative is fully up to you, as is the overall moral takeaway. The user could be either an observer of an ongoing narrative, or instead a direct agent in the story. Check out [Twine, Yarn, and Ink](https://medium.com/@haikus_by_KN/twine-2-vs-ink-a-quick-and-dirty-unity-integration-comparison-99fe1e4549d) â€” which all aim to simplify the difficulty of creating virtual narratives in Unity.

An entire plotline should be user-engageable, though aspects of the plot could be more refined than others.

	#### Deliverables 
	- 3-5 minute interactive experience
	- Refined storyboard of *ideal* experience, as well as how design decisions intervene in *non-ideal* experiences
	- Compressed folder of all commented code and 2d/3d assets
	- Written story, with accompanying illustrative screenshots, as a digital book

	#### Considerations
	- How will your story keep user interest? What will you want them to take away?
	- How will the art direction of your assets reinforce the moral of your story? 
	- Is your experiences designed around repeated viewings? Could the story be generative in some way?
	- How is your story embedded in a larger, understandable universe? What hints can your experience offer to help users understand the world that they are immersed in more holistically?
	- How will your story branch to allow user choice? Or alternatively, how will the design of your experience coerce users to make specific choices willingly?

## 3D Music Video

Create an interactive musical VR experience based on a song, album, or soundscape of your choice. The content of the music should be reflected not only in the visuals and aesthetics of the experience, but also in the narrative arc of the piece (in other words, no [contextless music visualizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCoLCyfgiJU)). The design of the sound in 3D space should take into account the spatial, 3-dimensional opportunities offered by VR. 

	#### Deliverables 
	- 3-5 minute musical experience
	- Refined storyboard of *ideal* experience, as well as how design decisions intervene in *non-ideal* experiences
	- Compressed folder of all commented code and 2d/3d assets
	- Translation diagram clarifying how musical content is mapped to visual content, and why you made those decisions

	#### Considerations
	- How will your musical experience keep user interest?
	- How will your aesthetic choices reinforce musicality, and not distract from it?
	- Can the user manipulate the music? How will that interaction take place?
	- What is the interplay between handmade and generative content?
	- Does your experience help users understand how the muscial composition comes together from disparate parts? Or rather does it attempt to further mystify musicality?
