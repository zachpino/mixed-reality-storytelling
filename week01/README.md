### Week 1 · Simple Marker AR and VR with A-Frame 

-----

Let's explore a simple, but highly extensible, web framework for creating AR and VR experiences — [A-Frame](https://aframe.io), created by the team behind Mozilla Firefox. Check out the many examples on their website, with both mobile and traditional computing devices.

A-Frame can create both VR and AR experiences. Virtual Reality experiences support VR controllers, and Augmented Reality experiences support both marker and markerless 3D model placement (through integration with [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/README.md)). All these experiences allow scripting with Javascript and styling and animation with friendly HTML attributes and CSS. 

Read through the [documentation](https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/introduction/) for more of the abilities of A-Frame!

##### Homework

All of these *will be shared with the class*.

- Continue working with A-Frame, and **compose an animated scene reminiscent of an artist of your choice**. Push yourself on this, there are lots of interesting [resources available](https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/randomizer/) for a-frame.
- Visit somewhere in Chicago a VR or AR experience, and document yourself there with a selfie. Research the experience as best as you can. With what tools was it made? 
- Find an interesting digital AR/VR-enabled mobile application or website compatible with your Google Cardboard glasses. Can you find how it was created?
- Investigate AR and VR development tools, hardware, and software. If you could learn how to do anything in this course, what would it be? Prepare an argument.
